CSCN8010_Final_Project

Objective 
    The objective of our project is to develop a facial expression recognition model using neural networks and convolutional layers in deep learning.
    The model will detect and classify facial expressions in images, contributing to mental health monitoring and patient care applications. 
    By accurately identifying facial expressions, healthcare professionals can better assess and track patients’ emotional well-being and mental state.
    Additionally, it can be utilized for psychology research studies, providing valuable insights into human emotions and behavior.

Motivation 
    Facial emotion recognition plays a crucial role in mental health care. 
    It offers an efficient way to evaluate patients’ emotional states, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions about treatment plans. 
    Understanding and addressing mental health conditions are essential for ensuring the well-being of patients and our model can provide valuable support in achieving that goal.

Method 
    We are going to use deep neural networks to solve the problem. 
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture that is one of the state of art methods in image classification. 
    In the domain of deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) represents a category of artificial neural networks primarily utilized for the analysis of visual imagery. 
    CNNs employ a specialized mathematical operation known as convolution, replacing the conventional matrix multiplication, within at least one of their layers.

Dataset 
    From Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-with-deep-learning
    The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. 
    Each image corresponds to a facial expression in one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). 
    The dataset contains approximately 36K images. 80% of the images are contained inside the train folder, and the last 20% are inside the validation folder.
